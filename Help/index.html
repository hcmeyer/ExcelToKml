<p>The <b>ExcelToKml</b> program converts the data in Excel files with a particular format into Google Earth/Maps Kml files. The program can only Open and Save .xls files, the older binary format used by Excel. It cannot Open or Save the newer .xslx or .xml Excel file formats.
</p>
<p>Each row in the Excel file will be converted to a PlaceMark in the Kml file, a location on a map, with a Popup box containing Name and Description, with a either a website or a <a href="other.html#MailTo">mailto</a> link, followed by Telephone and Postal Address.<p>
<p>Two columns in the Excel file row are Latitude and Longitude, used to locate the Placemark on the map. The Latitude and Longitude can be data previously input to the Excel file by the SpreadSheet program, or can be <a href="rowEdit.html#Lookup">looked up</a> from address data contained in other columns in the row. This process is called <b>GeoCoding</b><p>
<p>The rows are presented one at a time in a form for GeoCoding or other editing, and the changes saved back to the same Excel file read, or to another Excel file, with a different name or directory.<p>
<p>
The Excel File may have more than one sheet. Each sheet will become an internal folder in the Kml file, with its own <a href="rowEdit.html#SheetControls">icon</a> for placemarks.
</p>  
<p>The <b>ExcelToKml</b> program does not allow rows or sheets to be added to the Excel file</p>
<p>
The <b>ExcelToKml</b> program can open one Excel File at a time.</p>
