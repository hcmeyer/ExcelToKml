<body>
<p>The <b>Excel Menu</b> and Toolbar Buttons are used to Open and Save Excel data files. The ExcelToKml program cannot produce new Excel files, but can save existing files with new names. The Quit function, to close files and end the program is also on this menu.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="ExcelOpen">
<p>
<b>Excel Open</b> - Open and Read an existing Excel File. This will open a file dialog to pick the Excel File to Open. Opening an Excel File will replace the current row data, and clear the Kml data. If the current Excel or Kml data has been changed, and not saved, you will be asked if you want to save them, before opening the other Excel File.
</p>
</li>
<li id="ExcelSave">
<p>
<b>Excel Save</b> - Save the Open Excel File, with the same Name, in the same Directory. This does not allow selection of file name or directory to Save to. It is not enabled unless the row data has been changed by editing, or GeoCode lookup. If data has not been changed, the menu item and toolbar button will be "Greyed out", and will be disabled.
</p>
</li>
<li id="ExcelSaveAs">
<p>
<b>Excel Save As</b> - Save the Open Excel file, with a different name, or in a different directory. This will allow selection of file name or directory, opening a file dialog to pick what name or directory to Save to. It is always enabled if an Excel File has been Opened, regardless of whether the Row data has been changed by editing, or GeoCode lookup.
</p>
</li>
<li id="ExcelQuit">
<p>
<b>Quit</b> - Close all files, Quit the program. This will check that any changed Excel or Kml data has been saved to a File, and ask about data that needs saving before quiting.
</p>
</li>
<li id="RecentlyOpen">
<p>
<b>Recently Open</b> - Below the Quit is a list of up to 9 of the recently opened Excel files. If one of these files is clicked, it will be Opened, replacing the current Excel data, and clearing the Kml data. If the current Excel or Kml data has been changed, and not saved to Files, you will be asked if you want to save them, before opening the other Excel file.
